### 📌 Prompt:

**Role:**  
You are a VMware expert. Your task is to analyze CPU and memory usage metrics of virtual machines (VMs) and suggest optimizations.

---

**Input Format (JSON):**  
Each VM has the following fields:

- `VM_Name`: string – The hostname of the virtual machine  
- `Current_CPU`: number – The number of currently allocated vCPUs  
- `CPU_Usage`: object – Historical CPU usage statistics over the past 3 months:
  - `avg`: average CPU usage (%)  
  - `p95`: 95th percentile CPU usage (%)  
  - `p99`: 99th percentile CPU usage (%)  

- `Current_Memory`: number – The amount of currently allocated memory (in GB)  
- `Memory_Usage`: object – Historical memory usage statistics over the past 3 months:
  - `avg`: average memory usage (GB)  
  - `p95`: 95th percentile memory usage (GB)  
  - `p99`: 99th percentile memory usage (GB) 

Data is provided as:  
```json
$batchJson
```

**What You Need to Do:**

1. **Reclaim Score Calculation (0–100)**
   - Give a `Reclaim_Score_CPU` and `Reclaim_Score_Memory` for each VM
   - High score = overprovisioned (i.e., resource waste)
   - Be conservative; avoid inflating scores

2. **Suggest Optimized Resources:**
   - **CPU:**
     - If score is high, suggest a lower but realistic `Suggested_CPU`
     - Minimum: 2 vCPU (always even)
     - Must not be less than 50% of `Current_CPU`

   - **Memory:**
     - If score is high, suggest a reduced `Suggested_Memory` (GB)
     - Minimum: 4 GB (always even)
     - Must not be less than 50% of `Current_Memory`

   ⚠️ Be cautious — avoid aggressive downsizing that could hurt performance

**Output Format (JSON array):**  
Return only the final result in this structure — **no explanations, no extra text**:

```json
[
  {
    "VM_Name": "vm-hostname",
    "Current_CPU": 8,
    "Reclaim_Score_CPU": 25,
    "Suggested_CPU": 8,
    "Current_Memory": 16,
    "Reclaim_Score_Memory": 30,
    "Suggested_Memory": 14
  }
]
```

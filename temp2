You are a VMware systems performance and capacity optimization expert.
You have been provided with a dataset of virtual machines (VMs) in an Excel file. The dataset includes the following columns:
1. VMware VM hostname
2. Current vCPUs allocated to the VMs
3. Average CPU usage percentage of the VMs over the last 3 months
4. 95th percentile CPU usage percentage of the VMs over the last 3 months
5. 99th percentile CPU usage percentage of the VMs over the last 3 months
6. Current memory (in GB) allocated to the VMs
7. Average memory usage percentage of the VMs over the last 3 months
8. 95th percentile memory usage percentage of the VMs over the last 3 months
9. 99th percentile memory usage percentage of the VMs over the last 3 months
 
The data is as follows:

Your task is to analyze the data and provide recommendations for optimizing resource allocation for each VM. Specifically, for each VM, determine the following:
 
1. **VMName**: The hostname of the VM.
2. **ReclaimScoreCPU**: A score between 0 and 100 indicating the potential over-provisioning of CPU resources.
3. **SuggestedCPU**: Suggest a new CPU allocation that is slightly above the typical peak usage (e.g., 95th percentile), ensuring it is reasonable and conservative. Otherwise, retain the current CPU allocation. The suggested CPU allocation must not be below the 95th percentile demand.
4. **ReclaimScoreMemory**: A score between 0 and 100 indicating the potential over-provisioning of memory resources.
5. **SuggestedMemory**: Suggest a new memory allocation that is slightly above the typical peak usage (e.g., 95th percentile), rounded to an even number, with a minimum of 4 GB. Otherwise, retain the current memory allocation. The suggested memory allocation must not be below the 95th percentile demand.
 
Additional guidelines:
- The maximum reclaimable score for both CPU and memory is 100, and the minimum is 0.
- Current CPU and memory allocations should positively influence the reclaim scores.
- Ensure that the final suggested CPU and memory allocations are realistic, cautious, and prevent performance issues during usage spikes.
- Be more conservative when suggesting resource reductions
 
Based on this analysis, generate a table with the following columns:
- VMName
- Current CPU
- ReclaimScoreCPU
- SuggestedCPU
- Current Memory
- ReclaimScoreMemory
- SuggestedMemory
 
Convert the table results into JSON format without showing intermediate calculations or explanations.

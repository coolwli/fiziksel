Below is long-term resource utilization data for a virtual machine (VM).
The data has been collected via the vROps API at 1-hour intervals.
Please analyze the data according to the following steps:

General Trend and Utilization Analysis:

Identify and interpret usage trends (e.g., increases, decreases, fluctuations).

Evaluate how resource utilization intensity has changed over time.

Anomaly Detection:

Detect any sudden spikes, drops, or unusual patterns in usage.

Indicate the specific time periods where anomalies are concentrated.

Capacity and Risk Analysis:

Identify periods of excessive or insufficient resource usage.

Based on long-term usage statistics, assess whether the current resource allocation is sufficient.

Would you recommend reclaiming any underutilized resources?

Forecasting (Optional):

Based on the observed usage patterns, estimate the expected usage trend for the next week.

Assess the risk of hitting critical threshold levels.

Recommendations:

Provide suggestions to increase, decrease, or reconfigure the current resource allocation.

If necessary, outline proactive measures or actions that should be taken.



Please summarize all findings in a single, detailed paragraph, including technical insights and justifications for each conclusion.

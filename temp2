  Here is the input dataset as JSON array.  
  For each VM object:
  - vm_name: string  
  - vCPU: current vCPU count (integer)  
  - RAM_GB: current RAM in GB (integer)  
  - avg_CPU_pct, p95_CPU_pct, p99_CPU_pct: CPU usage percentiles  
  - avg_RAM_pct, p95_RAM_pct, p99_RAM_pct: RAM usage percentiles  

  Your tasks:
  1. Compute a **reclaim_score** between 0–100 for each VM.  
     - Do **not** be over‑aggressive: leave a small safety buffer for spikes.  
     - Score should reflect how much resource can be reclaimed: higher score → more reclaimable.  
  2. Propose a **new_vCPU** and **new_RAM_GB** pair for each VM.  
     - new_RAM_GB minimum is **4** GB.  
     - Always output an array of two numbers: [new_vCPU, new_RAM_GB].  
     - Ensure you leave at least ~10 % headroom above the VM’s 99th percentile usage.  
  3. Output result as JSON array of objects with fields:
     - vm_name
     - reclaim_score
     - new_allocation: [new_vCPU, new_RAM_GB]

  Here’s the input:
